How It Works

1. Initiate Escrow:

The sender and receiver define the terms of the transaction (amount, assets, timeline).

The buyer deposits funds into the SuiTrust escrow smart contract.



2. Escrow Agreement:

Both parties review and confirm the terms of the escrow agreement. This contract includes the specific conditions for the release of funds (such as delivery of goods, completion of a task, etc.).



3. Fulfillment of Conditions:

The receiver or seller fulfills the agreed terms (e.g., delivery of a product, completion of a service).

The sender verifies the fulfillment of these terms.



4. Release of Funds:

Upon mutual agreement or verification of the conditions, the funds are automatically released to the recipient.

If there's a dispute, the arbitration process is triggered.



5. Dispute Resolution:

A trusted arbitrator or multi-sig system resolves any disagreements, ensuring fairness.



6. Finalization:

Upon successful completion, the transaction is finalized, and users can leave feedback to build their reputation score.

Use Cases

SuiTrust can be used for a wide variety of transactions across different industries, including:

1. P2P Crypto Trading – Secure exchanges of cryptocurrency for fiat or other crypto.

3. Real Estate Transactions – Secure transfers of property assets.


4. NFT & Digital Asset Trading – Escrow for digital goods, including art, gaming assets, and NFTs.


5. Cross-Border Payments – International money transfers with trustless security.


6. Product/Service Purchases – Buyer protection for physical or digital goods.


7. Peer-to-Peer Lending – Decentralized loans with repayment conditions tracked via smart contracts.

Technical Architecture

SuiTrust is built on the Sui blockchain, leveraging its fast, secure, and scalable environment for decentralized applications (dApps). Here's a high-level overview of the architecture:

Smart Contracts handle escrow agreements, funds locking, and dispute resolution.

Off-chain Integrations like PayPal, bank transfers, and third-party fiat on-ramps are integrated via API.

Reputation System is on-chain, storing user transaction history and ratings.

User Interfaces are built using React, connecting to the Sui blockchain and handling all transaction interactions.



---

Reputation System

The reputation system ensures trust and security by assigning a score to users based on their transaction history. Here’s how it works:

Successful Transactions: Positive reputation points are given after the successful completion of each escrow agreement.

Dispute Handling: Users who resolve disputes favorably earn additional reputation.

Negative Feedback: Users who fail to fulfill agreements or engage in fraudulent activities will receive negative feedback, impacting their reputation score.


The higher a user’s reputation, the more likely they are to be trusted in future transactions. This helps build a safer and more reliable environment for users.


---

KYC Integration

While SuiTrust operates as a decentralized, non-custodial platform, KYC can be required for specific use cases:

High-Value Transactions: If the transaction exceeds certain thresholds or if the user requests to use fiat on-ramps, KYC/AML verification may be triggered.

Jurisdictional Requirements: Depending on the user's location, certain jurisdictions may require KYC for legal compliance.


KYC processes are designed to be optional, based on the user’s preferences or transaction specifics. If needed, a third-party KYC service can be integrated, ensuring users retain control over their data and identity.


---

Legal Compliance

SuiTrust is designed to be legally compliant with global regulations, including but not limited to:

GDPR (EU) – Personal data is handled with strict privacy and security standards.

AML/KYC (U.S. and EU) – Supports optional KYC/AML integrations when required.

Financial Regulations – Designed to comply with financial laws in regions like the U.S., EU, and Asia.


Users may choose to integrate KYC/AML when required by the transaction type or jurisdiction.
